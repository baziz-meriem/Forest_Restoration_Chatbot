Calling restoration “the Big Lie,” Katz argued t hat \\nrestoration was simply the latest manifestation of human domination of nature: “A ‘restored’ \\nnature is an artifact created to meet human satisfaction and interests. Thus, on the most \\nfundamental level, it is an unrecognized manifestation of the insidio us dream of the human \\ndomination of nature.
